- 👋 Hi, I’m @neil-glydways
- 👀 I’m interested in all things autonomy, and I was a mechanical engineer in a former life, so I like building stuff too.  
- 🌱 I’m currently on the Motion Planning and Controls team, transitioning to the Localization/Perception team. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Autonomy software and simulation systems.  
- 📫 Write me at my glydways email account.
